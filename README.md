## Project Overview

This project revolutionizes India's National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) through AI-powered automation. Using advanced machine learning techniques deployed on IBM Watson Studio, we've created an intelligent system that predicts the most suitable NSAP scheme for applicants with **98.4% accuracy**.

### Key Benefits
- Reduces processing time from weeks to seconds
- Eliminates human bias in scheme allocation
- Ensures deserving citizens receive timely assistance
- Scales effortlessly with increasing applicant volumes

---

## Problem Statement

The National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) is a welfare initiative by the Government of India to support elderly persons, widows, and individuals with disabilities living below the poverty line. Manual verification leads to:

- ‚è∞ Delays in benefit delivery
- ‚ùå Incorrect scheme allocations  
- üìà Scalability issues
- üí∏ Administrative overhead

---

## Solution

Our AI-powered system automates the entire eligibility prediction process:

1. **Data Collection**: Historical applicant data from AI Kosh NSAP dataset
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize applicant information
3. **Machine Learning**: Random Forest Classifier for accurate predictions
4. **Deployment**: IBM Watson Studio cloud deployment
5. **Real-time Predictions**: Instant scheme recommendations

---

## Technology Stack

- **Platform**: IBM Watson Studio
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Cloud**: IBM Cloud Object Storage
- **Deployment**: AutoAI Web Service Endpoint
- **Accuracy**: 98.4%
- **Processing Time**: Under 2 seconds

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ **Automated Eligibility Assessment**
- ‚úÖ **Multi-class Scheme Prediction**
- ‚úÖ **Real-time Processing**
- ‚úÖ **High Accuracy (98.4%)**
- ‚úÖ **No-code Deployment**
